 <p style="margin: 5px;"> <center> 
	 Hello there! I'm Jamie, a 23 year old Computer Science and Mathematics major at Liberty University in Lynchburg Virginia focusing in Cyber Security.<br> My passion for coding is new but strong. Before transferring to Liberty I began my education at Cuesta College in <br>San Luis Obispo California (<em> Yup, I am West Coast gal on the East Coast! </em>), this is where I was introduced to coding. At Cuesta I also discovered my love for <br>tutoring mathematics, from one-on-one to group supplemental instruction workshops ranging from topics in basic arithmetic to precalculus and everything in between.
